## yum install nodejs make gcc-c++ -y
#  Let's now set up the catalogue application.
#
#  As part of operating system standards, we run all the applications and databases as a normal user but not with root user.
#
#  So to run the catalogue service we choose to run as a normal user and that user name should be more relevant to the project. Hence we will use roboshop as the username to run the service.
#
#  # useradd roboshop
#  So let's switch to the roboshop user and run the following commands.
#
#  $ curl -s -L -o /tmp/catalogue.zip "https://github.com/roboshop-devops-project/catalogue/archive/main.zip"
#  $ cd /home/roboshop
#  $ unzip /tmp/catalogue.zip
#  $ mv catalogue-main catalogue
#  $ cd /home/roboshop/catalogue
#  $ npm install
#NOTE: We need to update the IP address of MONGODB Server in systemd.service file
#  Now, lets set up the service with systemctl.
#
#  # mv /home/roboshop/catalogue/systemd.service /etc/systemd/system/catalogue.service
#  # systemctl daemon-reload
#  # systemctl start catalogue
#  # systemctl enable catalogue
